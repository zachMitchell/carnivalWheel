Experiment: count up until we reach total. If we can't go higher and there's numbers left over, place the remainder in the array (sorted).
Split into X number of clumps. If the number of clumps > actual numbers, divide current results, double array size.

The case above I would assume would be rare. Most of the time, the grand total would be bigger than the amount of pieces needed to be split the use case I'm building.

Holy cow... It's FINALLY done. This file may now RIP.
